    "The sculptures talk of a recent event now passed, but also hint at the perpetual human cycle of boom, exuberance, downfall and rediscovery. The film and audio backdrop depict the natural and manmade terrain that informs these cycles and is itself dramatically influenced by the human motions now frozen within. The city rises and falls in the background as the digital dust that both sustains and threatens our time."
